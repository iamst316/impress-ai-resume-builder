 
Hello Impress.ai,

Please note the following:-

- I have added all the points in the mandatory portion of the assignment.
- It was suggested to use a taggit like plugin for skills. I couldn't find a decent plugin for react, so I made one from scratch, it isnt perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it gets the job done.
- As for the optional, I have added the following:-
    - React Router for creating, viewing and editing resume.
    - Redux Toolkit has been used for centralised state management(had to learn this on the spot before attempting the assignment).

Thank you for this opportunity!
